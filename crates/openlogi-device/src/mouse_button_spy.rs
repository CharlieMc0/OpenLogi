//! HID++ `MouseButtonSpy` (feature `0x8110`) — the G-line raw button-event tap
//! that stands in for `0x1b04` on mice which do not report it.
//!
//! Unlike `0x1b04` diversion this is a *tap*: starting it does not stop a
//! button's native HID report. Only buttons with no native report at all can
//! be dispatched from it without double-firing.
